The goal of treasure is to provide basic, generic unit-costing help for [malariasimulation](https://mrc-ide.github.io/malariasimulation/).

Functionality is fairly minimal. A key goal of treasure is to be a transparent and
version controlled repository for unit cost estimates that included detailed citations
or referencs for cost sources.

## Installation

You can install the development version of treasure from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/treasure")
```
## Updates

Updates and improvements are encouranged via [PRs](https://github.com/mrc-ide/treasure/pulls)!

Updates should be citable from a published source.
They should be in-line with the aim of this package to be source for generic costing
estimates and therefore should be broadly representative of the costing for a given
intervention, and not focussed on a specific location or implementation approach.

Any suggested update should include:
1. An update to the costing function deafault value.
2. Updated documentation for the function including a citable source in the references section.
3. Corresponding update to the unit tests for the modified costing function.
