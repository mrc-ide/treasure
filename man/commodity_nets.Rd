}
\arguments{
\item{use_rate}{A single value or vector of usage rates.}

\item{distribution_timesteps}{Timesteps of distributions (days). By default,
we can assume that net distributions happen on the first day of each year.
For example c(1, 366)}

\item{crop_timesteps}{Timesteps of crop estimates (days). If assuming distribtions
occur on the first day of each year, a reasonable asumption would be that the
crop (and therefore corresponding usage) estimates were taken at the mid-point of each year.
For example c(1, 366) + 183.}

\item{half_life}{Country-specific) half-life of nets in days.}

\item{par}{Population at risk estimates.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for the crop_to_distribution function in netz}

\item{itn_use}{A single value or vector of desired target usages to model.}
